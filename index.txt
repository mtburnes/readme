Michael - 2

I am a senior working on my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I'm from St. Louis, Missouri. I came from two different universities. First one was the Missouri University of Science and Technology (Rolla, MO) but that university refused to let me take freshman CS courses, so I left. Next university was the University of Missouri - Saint Louis which I left because the CS program was a little too easy. I came here because I got a glowing recommendation from a friend who left MS&T. I am a guitarist and play primarily rock and jazz. 

I hope to do software development in the future, or possibly system administration. I used to work as IT staff at my old high school after I graduated. 

I played in jazz band in high school my senior year.
